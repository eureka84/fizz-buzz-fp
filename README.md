# FizzBuzz Kata

It starts from master with a basic implementation with tests and then there are 3 branches: 

- without_libraries: a functional refactoring using only kotlin lang features
- using-arrow-kt-option-monoid-by-hand: a functional refactoring using arrow-kt Option and monoids defined by me
- fully-arrow-kt-refactor: a functional refactoring using all the goodies from arrow-kt
